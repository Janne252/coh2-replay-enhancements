# Features
![](screenshots/example-01.png)
- All events of an entire squad dying are indicated with in-game UI elements
- Death event indicators are displayed for 60 seconds 
- Any death event indicator can be removed by pressing `Ctrl+D` (likely not the final hotkey, can be easily changed)
    - Selection of which death event indicator is removed is based on distance to the current camera position
    - Selection may be based on mouse position instead in the future to allow more accurate control
